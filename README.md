# Raytracer

Project created in order to learn how a raytracer works as well as a means of learning C++.

As a reference and a guide I'm using a series of books by Peter Shirley. It can be found [here](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io).

Currently I've finished the material in the [first book in the series](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
